However, evidence from aerobic exercise training suggests that early changes in functional LV wall mechanics may occur prior to and independently of changes in LV size, although short-term changes in LV mechanics and structural remodelling in response to RT protocols have not been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of RT on LV mechanics in healthy men performing 2 different time-under-tension protocols. Forty recreationally trained men (age: 23 ± 3 years) were randomized into 12 weeks of whole-body higher-repetition RT (20-25 repetitions/set to failure at ∼30%-50% 1 repetition maximum (1RM); n = 13), lower-repetition RT (8-12 repetitions/set to failure at ∼75%-90% 1RM; n = 13), or an active control period (n = 14). Speckle tracking echocardiography was performed at baseline and following the intervention period. Neither RT program altered standard measures of LV volumes (end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, or ejection fraction; P > 0.05) or indices of LV mechanics (total LV twist, untwisting rate, twist-to-shortening ratio, untwisting-to-twist ratio, or longitudinal strain; P > 0.05). This is the first longitudinal study to assess both LV size and mechanics after RT in healthy men, suggesting a maintenance of LV size and twist mechanics despite peripheral muscle adaptations to the training programs.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that explored the effects of mental practice on pain, functionality and quality-of-life in individuals with CNSNP were searched using databases PubMed, Cochrane library, Medline via Ovid, Scopus, and PEDro from inception to July 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated the quality of the studies utilizing the PEDro scale.\nRESULTS: Six high-quality RCTs with 128 participants with CNSNP in the MI and AO groups, and 93 participants with CNSNP in the control group, were included in this review. Both AO and MI were effective in improving pain response and cervical joint position sense. However, AO was more efficient than MI and its effects were retained longer.

The purpose of this case report was to describe a process evaluation of the implementation of an evidence-based upper extremity rehabilitation intervention for stroke, the Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program, in a community setting.\nMETHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A partnership between a nonprofit support organization and a local community center was established to deliver the program in the community. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework with mixed methods was used to evaluate the implementation.\nRESULTS: Reach: Twenty people were screened, 14 people met eligibility requirements, and 13 consented to participate. The program reached approximately 1.25% of the potential target population. Effectiveness: Participants with stroke demonstrated significant improvement in upper extremity function and quality of life as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity, Action Research Arm Test, Rating of Everyday Arm-use in the Community and Home Scale, and Stroke Impact Scale. Adoption: Factors that facilitated program uptake were the well-planned implementation and the workplace coaching based on the audit results. Factors contributing to ongoing participation were the social support within the group environment and the instructor's capability of engaging the group. Implementation: A partnership between a nonprofit organization and a local community center was successfully established. The program was implemented as intended as verified by a fidelity checklist.

Maintenance: Both the partner organization and community center continued to offer the program.\nCONCLUSION: The Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program had good fidelity of the critical principles and core components and was effective in improving upper extremity function and quality of life.\nIMPACT: This partnership model may serve as the first step for future larger-scale implementation and could be used to move other stroke rehabilitation interventions into community settings."}, {"pmcid": "39438877", "title": "Home-based guidance training system with interactive visual feedback using kinect on stroke survivors with moderate to severe motor impairment.", "text": "The home-based training approach benefits stroke survivors by providing them with an increased amount of training time and greater feasibility in terms of their training schedule, particularly for those with severe motor impairment. Computer-guided training systems provide visual feedback with correct movement patterns during home-based training. This study aimed to investigate the improvement in motor performance among stroke survivors with moderate to severe motor impairment after 800 min of training using a home-based guidance training system with interactive visual feedback. Twelve patients with moderate to severe stroke underwent home-based training, totaling 800 min (20-40 min per session, with a frequency of 3 sessions per week). The home-based guidance training system uses Kinect to reconstruct the 3D human body skeletal model and provides real-time motor feedback during training. The training exercises consisted of six core exercises and eleven optional exercises, including joint exercises, balance control, and coordination. Pre-training and post-training assessments were conducted using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb (FMA-UE), Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Lower Limb (FMA-LE), Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Barthel Index (BI), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), as well as kinematic data of joint angles and center of mass (COM). The results indicated that motor training led to the attainment of the upper limit of functional range of motion (FROM) in hip abduction, shoulder flexion, and shoulder abduction. However, there was no improvement in the active range of motion (AROM) in the upper extremity (U/E) and lower extremity (L/E) joints, reaching the level of the older healthy population. Significant improvements were observed in both left/right and superior/inferior displacements, as well as body sway in the mediolateral axis of the COM, after 800 min of training. In conclusion, the home-based guidance system using Kinect aids in improving joint kinematics performance at the level of FROM and balance control, accompanied by increased mediolateral body sway of the COM for stroke survivors with moderate to severe stroke.

We assess the potential effectiveness of two types of augmented auditory feedback on the re-learning of arm reaching in individuals with stroke: (a) real-time knowledge of performance (KP) feedback and (b) rhythmic cueing in the form of knowledge of results (KR) feedback.\nMETHOD: Five participants with stroke underwent short-term practice, reaching with their affected arm with KP, KR and no feedback, on separate days. We assessed range of motion of the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow) and trunk, mean error and variability of the performed trajectory, and movement time, before and after training.\nRESULTS: All participants benefitted from practice with feedback, though the effects varied across participants and feedback type. In three participants, KP feedback increased elbow extension and reduced compensatory trunk flexion. In four participants, KR feedback reduced movement time taken to perform the reach. Of note, one participant benefitted mostly from KP feedback, which increased shoulder flexion and elbow extension, and decreased compensatory trunk flexion and mean error.\nCONCLUSIONS: Within day practice with augmented auditory feedback improves reaching in individuals with stroke. This warrants further investigation with longer practice periods in a larger sample size.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: After practice, augmented feedback is the second most important factor that facilitates motor learning. Music-based augmented auditory feedback has potential to enhance reaching abilities in individuals with stroke. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of this feedback over a longer training period in a larger sample size."}]}

Too often OA also has been considered not interesting, not important, and not responsive to conservative treatment. However, reports documenting the personal and socioeconomic impact of OA are increasing recognition of its importance [1] and recent advances in understanding its pathogenesis are stimulating research [2]. OA is characterized by specific changes in articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Cartilage shows fibrillations, increased water content, and loss of integrity. Underlying bone is less compliant and may exhibit microfractures, sclerosis, and osteophytes at joint margins [3]. These changes result in increased friction, decreased shock absorption, and greater impact loading of the joint. The traditional view of OA is that the disease process starts with an unrepaired injury to articular cartilage. There is also evidence, however, that reduced compliance in bone and periarticular structures may initiate degenerative processes [4,5].

The well documented benefits of creatine supplementation in young adults, including increased lean body mass, increased strength, and enhanced fatigue resistance are particularly important to older adults. With aging and reduced physical activity, there are decreases in muscle creatine, muscle mass, bone density, and strength. However, there is evidence that creatine ingestion may reverse these changes, and subsequently improve activities of daily living. Several groups have demonstrated that in older adults, short-term high-dose creatine supplementation, independent of exercise training, increases body mass, enhances fatigue resistance, increases muscle strength, and improves the performance of activities of daily living. Similarly, in older adults, concurrent creatine supplementation and resistance training increase lean body mass, enhance fatigue resistance, increase muscle strength, and improve performance of activities of daily living to a greater extent than resistance training alone. Additionally, creatine supplementation plus resistance training results in a greater increase in bone mineral density than resistance training alone. Higher brain creatine is associated with improved neuropsychological performance, and recently, creatine supplementation has been shown to increase brain creatine and phosphocreatine. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that cognitive processing, that is either experimentally (following sleep deprivation) or naturally (due to aging) impaired, can be improved with creatine supplementation.

Data were analyzed with two- and three-way ANOVA.\nRESULTS: After 12 wk of training, RTR increased total body mass, fat-free mass, strength, and thigh volume and mass; however, they increased myostatin mRNA, myostatin, FLRG, cortisol, glucocorticoid receptor, and myofibrillar protein after 6 and 12 wk of training (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Resistance training and/or increased glucocorticoid receptor expression appears to up-regulate myostatin mRNA expression. Furthermore, it is possible that any plausible decreases in skeletal muscle function from the observed increase in serum myostatin were attenuated by increased serum FLRG levels and the concomitant down-regulation of the activin IIb receptor. It is therefore concluded that the increased myostatin in response to cortisol and/or resistance training appears to have no effects on training-induced increases in muscle strength and mass."}]}

However, nowadays, rather than the physician-based clinico-radiological methods, the patient-reported outcome measurements assessing their quality of life and function are gaining much popularity. This is specifically true in the part of the world where the patient needs almost complete degree of hip/knee flexion - for social, cultural, religious or occupational reason(s). The ability to squat can assess the mobility and stability of joints and thus the quality of squatting is a proxy reflection of the functional outcome after fixation of lower limb fracture. Thus, we studied to determine the inter-observer and intra-observer reliability of Radiographic Union Score for Tibia (RUST) and Squat and Smile (S & S) test in clinical photograph. We further calculated the sensitivity and specificity of S & S test in predicting healing of lower limb fracture fixed by intramedullary interlocking nail considering RUST as the gold standard.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data of solid Surgical Implant Generation Network (SIGN) intramedullary interlocking nailing from a single, university-based, high volume tertiary center where 56 consecutive adults with either tibial or femoral shaft fractures fixed with a SIGN nail within one year and not requiring any surgery till minimum of eighteen-month follow-up were included. Cases without either Anterior-Posterior (AP) view and/or Lateral (Lat.) view follow-up x-ray(s) or proper S & S clinical photograph (at least 1.5-year post fixation) were excluded. The x-rays (RUST criteria) and clinical photograph (S & S grading) were scored by two independent and blinded observers each and repeated after 1 month.\nRESULTS: The overall intra-observer reliability was from 0.773 to 0.825 and inter-observer reliability from 0.635 to 0.757 for RUST scoring which was from 0.687 to 0.785 and from 0.301 to 0.650 respectively for S & S scoring. The sensitivity and specificity of S & S in predicting fracture healing were up to 82.22% and 63.64% respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The S & S test is reliable to predict the healing of lower limb fracture fixed with an intramedullary nail. The test is more useful to determine healed fractures than to determine non-healed ones.

Acute bouts of exercise can improve the ability of amino acids to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) by activating mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, but it is not known whether exercise training may improve muscle sensitivity to amino acid availability.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if muscle protein anabolism is resistant to essential amino acids (EAAs) and whether resistance exercise training (RET) improves muscle sensitivity to EAA in healthy older adults.\nMETHODS: In a longitudinal study, 19 healthy older adults [mean ± SD age: 71 ± 4 y body mass index (kg/m2): 28 ± 3] were trained for 12 wk with a whole-body program of progressive RET (60-75% 1-repetition maximum). Body composition, strength, and metabolic health were measured pre- and posttraining. We also performed stable isotope infusion experiments with muscle biopsies pre- and posttraining to measure MPS and markers of amino acid sensing in the basal state and in response to 6.8 g of EAA ingestion.\nRESULTS: RET increased muscle strength by 16%, lean mass by 2%, and muscle cross-sectional area by 27% in healthy older adults (P < 0.05). MPS and mTORC1 signaling (i.e., phosphorylation status of protein kinase B, 4E binding protein 1, 70-kDa S6 protein kinase, and ribosomal protein S6) increased after EAA ingestion (P < 0.05) pre- and posttraining. RET increased basal MPS by 36% (P < 0.05); however, RET did not affect the response of MPS and mTORC1 signaling to EAA ingestion.\nCONCLUSION: RET increases strength and basal MPS, promoting hypertrophy in healthy older adults. In these subjects, a small dose of EAAs stimulates muscle mTORC1 signaling and MPS, and this response to EAAs does not improve after RET. Our data indicate that anabolic resistance to amino acids may not be a problem in healthy older adults. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02999802."}]}

Last search was run in December 2023, including studies since 2012. Selection criteria were studies with stroke participants of both sexes, aged 18 or more, with an intervention based on ERT. Accepted languages were English, Spanish or French. First search was done in pairs. Authors removed duplicate studies and those which did not meet inclusion criteria through title and abstracts. Finally, all authors, independently, screened the final search results and extracted data. Of 68 records identified, 15 were eligible and 6 were finally included (with moderate risk of bias), analyzing 159 participants. Body function (4 interventions, n = 84), gait (4 interventions, n = 115) and strength (3 interventions, n = 78) showed significantly better results when ERT was performed. Meta-analysis could not be done because of the few studies and their heterogeneity. This review provided low-moderate quality evidence suggesting that ERT might be effective at improving body function, strength, and gait after stroke. Besides, no harm was documented, and it was well-accepted."}]}

These aberrant movements are prevalent among stroke survivors and can hinder their progress in rehabilitation, making it crucial to address this issue. This study evaluated the efficacy of visual feedback, facilitated by an RGB-D camera, in reducing trunk compensation. In total, 17 able-bodied individuals and 18 stroke survivors performed reaching tasks under unrestricted trunk conditions and visual feedback conditions. In the visual feedback modalities, the target position was synchronized with trunk movement at ratios where the target moved at the same speed, double, and triple the trunk's motion speed, providing real-time feedback to the participants. Notably, trunk compensatory movements were significantly diminished when the target moved at the same speed and double the trunk's motion speed. Furthermore, these conditions exhibited an increase in the task completion time and perceived exertion among stroke survivors. This outcome suggests that visual feedback effectively heightened the task difficulty, thereby discouraging unnecessary trunk motion. The findings underscore the pivotal role of customized visual feedback in correcting aberrant upper limb movements among stroke survivors, potentially contributing to the advancement of robotic-assisted rehabilitation strategies.

Another important question is whether subjects benefit more from training forces that enhance their errors than from forces that reduce their errors. We exposed hemiparetic stroke survivors and healthy age-matched controls to a pattern of disturbing forces that have been found by previous studies to induce a dramatic adaptation in healthy individuals. Eighteen stroke survivors made 834 movements in the presence of a robot-generated force field that pushed their hands proportional to its speed and perpendicular to its direction of motion--either clockwise or counterclockwise. We found that subjects could adapt, as evidenced by significant after-effects. After-effects were not correlated with the clinical scores that we used for measuring motor impairment. Further examination revealed that significant improvements occurred only when the training forces magnified the original errors, and not when the training forces reduced the errors or were zero.

Sixteen healthy subjects and 51 stroke patients participated in the studies. Two vertical strain gauge force transducers attached to two force-measuring platforms were used to measure body weight distribution over the lower limbs. An auditory feedback device, specially developed for training body weight distribution on the paretic leg, employed two electronic balances sensing vertical forces from each foot, separately. Torque of maximal voluntary eccentric and concentric knee extensor and flexor actions at 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 deg/s was recorded with an isokinetic dynamometer together with surface electrodes from the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. When instructed to rise with even body weight on each lower limb, the stroke patients loaded the paretic leg more than when rising habitually, indicating that stroke patients have a latent motor capacity. Stroke patients' own estimations on visual analogue scales of body weight distributed on the paretic leg correlated with measured loading of the paretic leg in rising. After six weeks of training with auditory feedback of vertical ground reaction forces in the acute phase after stroke, the patients improved their loading of the paretic leg compared to a control group. The patients distributed body weight over the lower limbs nearly symmetrically while rising and while sitting down. The peak torque was not greater, however, than in the control group, rising with an asymmetrical body weight distribution. This implies that the patients after feedback training were better at using the knee extensor torque of the paretic leg to attain symmetrical body weight distribution over the lower extremities. Changes in improvement of physical performance and sitting to standing were greater than in the control group. No differences between groups were seen in performance of activities of daily living. Body weight distribution over the limbs in rising and in sitting down was re-tested on average 33 months after end of training. The symmetrical weight distribution after feedback training was not maintained over time. Knee extensor strength improved after six weeks of eccentric and concentric training, starting on average 27 months after stroke. The increase in strength was related to enhanced activation of agonist EMG activity. Eccentric training seems to be superior to concentric training with reference to a) improved body weight distribution over the lower limbs in rising, to b) increased knee extension torque and to c) increased agonist EMG activity without a concomitant, augmented EMG activity of the antagonistic knee flexor muscles. It was concluded that stroke patients have a latent motor capacity, that six weeks auditory feedback training promotes symmetrical body weight distribution which, however, is not consistent over time and that isokinetic eccentric training is superior to concentric training with reference to weight distribution in rising, knee extension torque and EMG activity."}]}

The evidence used to support this hypothesis is exclusively correlational analyses and these are often an afterthought using data collected to answer a different question of interest. Not only do these studies not infer causality, but they have inherent limitations associated with measurement error and limited inter-individual variability. To answer the question as to whether training-induced increases in muscle size lead to training-induced increases in strength requires a study designed to produce differential effects on muscle size based on group membership (i.e., one group increases muscle size and one does not) and observe how this impacts muscle strength. We have performed studies in our laboratory in which muscle strength increases similarly independent of whether muscle growth is or is not present, illustrating that the increases in muscle strength are not likely driven by increases in muscle size.

Maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (MVC), one-repetition maximum strength (1RM), biceps cross-sectional area (CSA) and elbow flexor volume (VOL) measures of the non-dominant and dominant arm were evaluated from baseline and after 12-wk RT twice per week. Correlations of MVC and VOL and 1RM and VOL were calculated in the whole cohort and within each sex independently.

This study aimed to develop a multidimensional fitness profile for these tactical athletes by defining Critical Success Factors and translating them into measurable performance indicators, then comparing Swiss Special Operations Forces operators and candidates with sports athletes.\nMETHOD: In a cross sectional, observational design, 262 male participants completed a tailored battery of laboratory and field tests: 69 Special Operations Forces operators, 175 Special Operations Forces candidates, and 18 athletes from disciplines such as decathlon, Thai boxing, wrestling, and ice hockey. Practitioner interviews established key mission critical factors, which were operationalized into tests of reaction time, power, strength, severe intensity muscular and cardiopulmonary work capacity, and aerobic endurance. To evaluate group and unit effects, we compared two Bayesian linear regression models: a baseline model (m₀) and a model (m₁) that included group as a fixed factor. Evidence for a group effect was quantified by the Bayes Factor and Probability of direction, where >90% is considered equal to an alpha level of 0.05, thus a non-negligible effect.\nRESULTS: Weekly training volume averaged 8.5 h for operators, 6.9 h for candidates, and 9.5 h for athletes. SOF operators and candidates demonstrated fitness levels comparable to sports athletes. Mean jumping distance was 2.43 m, relative hand-grip strength 1.51 kg/kg body mass, deadlift with 100 kg was 20 repetitions, and maximal oxygen uptake measured 54 ml/kg/min. Candidates recorded faster computer based reaction times than operators, while operators outperformed candidates and athletes in a close-quarters combat simulation. Both candidates and operators completed fewer 100 kg deadlift repetitions compared to the mean of the athletes.\nDISCUSSION: Swiss Special Operations Forces operators and candidates demonstrate fitness profiles on par with sports athletes across multiple domains, validating their designation as tactical athletes.

The trained subjects could produce a significantly (p less than 0.001) greater force (992 +/- 162 N).

In the untrained subjects, a significant correlation existed between strength and muscle cross-sectional area (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001). In the same group of subjects, there was a significant inverse relationship between muscle cross-sectional area and the ratio of strength to cross-sectional area (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001). The mean ratio of strength to cross-sectional area was 9.20 +/- 1.29 for the untrained group whereas for the trained group this ratio was 9.53 +/- 1.01. It is suggested that the inverse relationship between strength per unit cross-sectional area and cross-sectional area results in part from an increased angle of pennation in the larger muscles."}]}

Successful execution of rehabilitation trials requires a significant investment of time, staffing, and resources. With the recent completion of the Balance Training for Fall Reduction in COPD RCT, we report on the design, implementation, and execution of our trial using project management phases. We also highlight our lessons learned for consideration in future multi-centre rehabilitation trials.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective review of the planning, preparation, timelines, and personnel training involved in the execution of this study using four of the five project management phases described by Farrell et al. in 2010: (1) initiation, (2) planning, (3) execution, and (4) monitoring and controlling. We report descriptive statistics as percentages and counts and summarize our lessons learned.\nRESULTS: Ten outpatient PR programs in three continents participated. Thirty-one personnel worked on the trial across all sites. Enrolment began in January 2017 and was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 1275 patients were screened, 455 (36%) were eligible, 258 (57%) consented, 243 (53%) participated, and 130 (61%) completed the 12-month follow-up assessment. Lessons learned through our experience included (1) ensuring awareness of funder policies and considering the impact on collaborating sites; (2) preparing for the possibility of human resource and program disruptions; (3) anticipating site dropout and having a contingency plan in place; (4) planning and monitoring process measure data before, during, and after trial initiation; (5) ensuring frequent and consistent communication with and between collaborating sites; (6) maximizing features of database platform to ensure data set completeness and controlled data access; and (7) identifying strategies for increasing patient engagement in a high-demand study.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identify seven lessons learned through our experience conducting an international, multicentre rehabilitation-based RCT. These lessons can provide guidance to other trialists conducting studies with similar logistics and may assist with future trial planning and implementation."}]}

However, it remains unclear whether protein quantity or nutrient timing is central to positive adaptations. This study investigated the effect of total dietary protein content, whilst controlling for protein timing, on recovery in resistance trainees.\nMETHODS: Fourteen resistance-trained individuals underwent two 10-day isocaloric dietary regimes with a protein content of 1.8 g.kg[-1].d[-1] (PROMOD) or 2.9 g.kg[-1].d[-1] (PROHIGH) in a randomised, counterbalanced, crossover design. On days 8-10 (T1-T3), participants undertook resistance exercise under controlled conditions, performing 3 sets of squat, bench press and bent-over rows at 80% 1 repetition maximum until volitional exhaustion. Additionally, participants consumed a 0.4 g.kg[-1] whey protein concentrate/isolate mix 30 min before and after exercise sessions to standardise protein timing specific to training.

CC progresses through stages of increasing severity: pre-cachexia, cachexia and refractory cachexia. Two proposed underlying mechanisms that drive cancer-induced muscle wasting are the autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome systems. An increase in autophagic flux and proteolytic activity leads to atrophy of both cardiac and skeletal muscle, ultimately mediated by tumour or immune-secreted inflammatory cytokines. These pathways occur at a basal level to maintain cellular homeostasis; therefore, it is the overactivation of the pathways that leads to muscle atrophy. Recent evidence demonstrates the ability of aerobic and resistance training to restore these pathways to their basal levels. The mechanism is not yet understood, and more research is needed to determine exactly how exercise influences each pathway. However, exercise has great promise as a therapeutic strategy for CC because of the evidence for it preserving muscle mass and function, and attenuating protein degradative pathways.

Once thought to be caused by lactic acid buildup, a more recent theory is that it is caused by inflammatory process or tiny tears in the muscle fibers caused by eccentric contraction, or unaccustomed training levels. Exercises that involve many eccentric contractions will result in the most severe DOMS.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy men with no history of upper arm injury and no experience in resistance training were recruited. The mean age, height, and mass of the subjects were 22.8 +/- 1.2 years, 178.3 +/- 10.3 cm, and 75.0 +/- 14.2 kg, respectively. Subjects performed 8 sets of concentric and eccentric actions of the elbow flexors with each arm according to Stay protocol. One arm received 10 minutes of massage 30 minutes after exercise, the contralateral arm received no treatment. Measurements were taken at 9 assessment times: pre-exercise and postexercise at 10 min, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Dependent variables were range of motion, perceived soreness and upper arm circumference.\nRESULTS: There was noticed difference in perceived soreness across time between groups. The analysis indicated that massage resulted in a 10% to 20% decrease in the severity of soreness, but the differences were not significant.

However, it is known that unaccustomed eccentric exercise causes muscle damage and delayed pain, commonly defined as \"delayed onset muscle soreness\" (DOMS). The efficacy of herbal preparations in subjects suffering from DOMS has been reported in a few previous studies with small or moderate outcome measures related to muscle recovery. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of a polyherbal mixture containing whole Zingiber officinale Roscoe and Bixa orellana L., powders called ReWin(d), in young male athletes suffering from DOMS induced by a 1 h session of plyometric exercises.\nMETHODS: Thirty-three young male athletes participated in this randomized, Triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial: 17 of them assigned to the ReWin(d) group and 16 of them to the placebo group. Creatine kinase (CK) was measured as a muscle damage marker, pain was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), muscle performance was measured through half-squat exercise (HS) monitored with an accelerometer (Encoder), and heart rate variability (HRV) was monitored for 5 min with the subjects in the supine position. All determinations were performed before and after the eccentric session and 24, 48, and 72 h after the session.\nRESULTS: The eccentric exercise session caused an increase in CK at 24 and 48 h after exercise intervention in both groups (p < 0.001).

Beneficial effects of post-operative physical exercise have been reported in several cancer types, but so far comparable evidence in esophageal cancer patients is lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate effects of physical exercise on health-related quality of life in esophageal cancer patients following surgery.\nMETHODS: The Physical ExeRcise Following Esophageal Cancer Treatment (PERFECT) study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial including 150 esophageal cancer patients after surgery with curative intent.

The exercise group participates in a 12-week combined aerobic and resistance exercise program, supervised by a physiotherapist near the patient's home-address. In addition, participants in the exercise group are requested to be physically active for at least 30 min per day, every day of the week.

The multimodal rehabilitation group performed resistance exercises and moderate- to high-intensity aerobic interval exercises using a bicycle.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), pain, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), 30-second chair stand test, and grip strengths were assessed before and after the rehabilitation programs.\nRESULTS: Symptom scales of pain, dyspnea, and insomnia in the EORTC QLQ-C30 as well as 6MWT improved significantly after each program (P<.05). 6MWT (73.1±52.6 vs 28.4±14.3, P<.001, d=1.15), 30-second chair stand test (3.5±3.9 vs 0.35±2.0, P<.001, d=1.06), and left grip strength (1.2±1.3 vs 0.0±1.5, P=.002, d=0.42) improved significantly in the multimodal rehabilitation group compared with the pulmonary rehabilitation group. While right grip strength also showed more improvement for those undergoing the multimodal program, the mean strength difference was not clinically meaningful.\nCONCLUSIONS: A multimodal inpatient rehabilitation program instituted early after esophageal cancer surgery improved endurance for walking more than conventional pulmonary rehabilitation as measured by the 6MWT and the 30-second chair stand test."}]}

This study examined the first-ever continuous profile of neuromuscular fatigue throughout an entire ultra-trail race to understand fatigue mechanisms and inform training and pacing strategies.\nMETHODS: Fifty-five participants (43 men, 12 women; 45.2 ± 13.6 years) attempted six identical 26 km laps with 1,000 m elevation gain and loss per lap, 14 did not complete the course. Maximum knee-extensor and handgrip strength, peak-power output, and jump-height were measured pre-race, after each lap, and 12 h post-race using standardized protocols and linear mixed models.\nRESULTS: Knee-extensor strength decreased by ∼41% from pre-race to finish (p < .001), with substantial recovery (Δ26%-27%) at 12 h post-race. Handgrip strength showed minimal overall decline (Δ∼2%-5%), suggesting fatigue localized to the lower limbs. Peak-power and jump-height declined gradually (Δ6%-7% from early laps; p < .001). Critically, no significant relationship existed between the magnitude of strength loss and final ranking (early and late finishers showed no differences in strength profiles). However, participants who withdrew at lap 5 displayed substantially lower baseline strength (Δ27%; p = .004) and progressive strength declines compared to finishers, suggesting baseline neuromuscular capacity may influence completion likelihood.\nCONCLUSION: Continuous in-race profiling reveals that ultra-trail running induces substantial and predominantly peripheral neuromuscular fatigue in the lower limbs, with limited systemic effects. While strength loss magnitude does not predict race placement among finishers, lower baseline strength may increase non-completion risk. These findings underscore the importance of targeted strength training and metabolite-clearance strategies (e.g., glycogen replenishment, hydration, recovery) in ultra-endurance preparation."}]}

Given that match-induced residual fatigue can last up to 72 hours, many coaches naturally prioritize recovery in the days immediately following match day.

While these sessions may be implemented to increase training stimulus, there are limited data available regarding the efficacy of such a practice to improve recovery kinetics.\nMETHODS: In this narrative review, the authors look at the theoretical implications of performing upper-body resistance training on the day after match play on the status of various physiological and psychological systems, including neuromuscular, metabolic, hormonal, perceptual, and immunological recovery.\nRESULTS: The available evidence suggests that in most cases this practice, as currently implemented (ie, low volume, low intensity), is unlikely to be complementary (ie, does not accelerate recovery) but is potentially compatible (ie, does not impair recovery).\nCONCLUSION: Overall, because the perception of such sessions may be player dependent, their programming requires an individualized approach and should take into account match dynamics (eg, fixture scheduling, playing time, travel)."}, {"pmcid": "19130636", "title": "Comparison between different off-season resistance training programs in Division III American college football players.", "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of periodization and to compare different periodization models in resistance trained American football players.

However, the effect may vary from one patient (or study) to another.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of exercise and its potential determinants for pain, function, performance, and quality of life (QoL) in knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA).\nMETHODS: We searched 9 electronic databases (AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE Ovid, PEDro, PubMed, SPORTDiscus and Google Scholar) for reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing exercise-only interventions with usual care. The search was performed from inception up to December 2017 with no language restriction. The effect size (ES), with its 95% confidence interval (CI), was calculated on the basis of between-group standardised mean differences. The primary endpoint was at or nearest to 8 weeks. Other outcome time points were grouped into intervals, from<1 month to≥18 months, for time-dependent effects analysis. Potential determinants were explored by subgroup analyses. Level of significance was set at P≤0.10.\nRESULTS: Data from 77 RCTs (6472 participants) confirmed statistically significant exercise benefits for pain (ES 0.56, 95% CI 0.44-0.68), function (0.50, 0.38-0.63), performance (0.46, 0.35-0.57), and QoL (0.21, 0.11-0.31) at or nearest to 8 weeks.

For knee OA, evidence supports the benefits of various types of exercise for improving pain and function in the short term. However, there is much less research investigating the effects of exercise in patients with OA at other joints such as the hip and hand. It is important to note that while the magnitude of exercise benefits may be considered small to moderate, these effects are comparable to reported estimates for simple analgesics and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for OA pain but exercise has much fewer side effects. Exercise prescription should be individualized based on assessment findings and be patient centered involving shared decision making between the patient and clinician. Given that patient adherence to exercise declines over time, appropriate attention should be pain as reduced adherence attenuates the benefits of exercise. Given this, barriers and facilitators to exercise should be identified and strategies to maximize long-term adherence to exercise implemented."}]}

Exercise is important for preventing and/or managing the functional limitations associated with joint disease. Aquatic exercise is thought to be beneficial and is often recommended for people with osteoarthritis; however, few studies have examined the effects on people with osteoarthritis, and these have yielded inconsistent results.\nMETHODS: A two-group randomized controlled trial with a convenience sample was used.

The combination of the AirHeel brace and an eccentric training program has a synergistic effect.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1.\nMETHODS: One hundred patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: (1) eccentric training, (2) AirHeel brace, and (3) combination of eccentric training and AirHeel brace. Patients were evaluated at 6, 12, and 54 weeks after the beginning of the treatment protocol with ultrasonography, visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle score, and Short Form-36 (SF-36).\nRESULTS: The VAS score for pain, AOFAS score, and SF-36 improved significantly in all 3 groups at all 3 follow-up examinations. At the 3 time points (6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 54 weeks) of follow-up, there was no significant difference between all 3 treatment groups. In all 3 groups, there was no significant difference in tendon thickness after treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: The AirHeel brace is as effective as eccentric training in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy.

Group A performed a regimen of daily eccentric training associated with the AirHeel Brace (Donjoy Orthopedics, Vista, CA, USA). Group B performed the same eccentric training without the AirHeel Brace. Tendon microcirculatory mapping was performed using combined Laser-Doppler and spectrophotometry. Pre- and post-operative FAOS score and VAS score were used to evaluate the patients.\nRESULTS: The FAOS score and the VAS score showed significant improvements from pre-operative to post-operative values in both groups (A 5.1 +/- 2 vs. 2.9 +/- 2.4, 43% reduction and B: 5.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 3.6 +/- 2.4, 33% reduction, both p = 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in FAOS score and VAS score when comparing the two groups after the end of the intervention. In Group A, tendon oxygen saturation in the main body of the Achilles tendon showed significant increase from pre- to post-management values (68 +/- 12 vs.74 +/- 8%, p = 0.003). Post-capillary venous filling pressures showed significant reduction from pre- to post-intervention values.\nCONCLUSION: Eccentric training, associated or not with the AirHeel Brace, produces the same effect in patients with tendinopathy of the main body of the Achilles tendon. The combination of eccentric training with the AirHeel Brace can optimize tendon microcirculation, but these micro-circulator advantages do not translate into superior clinical performance when compared with eccentric training alone."}, {"pmcid": "20508011", "title": "Static progressive stretch brace as a treatment of pain and functional limitations associated with plantar fasciitis: a pilot study.", "text": "Plantar fasciitis is a common and hard-to-treat disorder of the foot.

Both groups received basic off-the-shelf foot orthoses. Data were available for 7 subjects in the exercise group and 6 in the brace group. Pain and functional limitations were evaluated with the Foot Functional Index pain subscale, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Scale, and great toe extension motion. Overall pain and morning pain improved in both groups as compared with baseline measures (repeated-measures analysis of variance, P = .04 and P = .02, respectively).

This prospective, randomized, blinded study was performed from May 1997 to July 2000. A total of 94 people (122 affected feet) fit the inclusion criterion and agreed initially to participate in a treatment study group. To achieve our purpose, study participants were randomized into two stretching groups. One group performed sustained Achilles tendon stretches (three minutes, three times daily), the other performed intermittent stretches (five sets, 20 seconds each, two times daily). Participants were evaluated once a month for a period of four months subsequent to diagnosis. At each monthly visit, participants completed subjective questionnaires about their pain. Also, a physical therapist measured each participant's Achilles tendon flexibility. The study determined that both sustained and intermittent Achilles tendon stretching exercises increase Achilles tendon flexibility. This increase in flexibility correlated with a decrease in pain.

A standard surface EMG controlled stress Roentgen test protocol was used, measuring talar tilt (TT) without support and with tape bandage or brace. Different levels of TT restraining by external support could be identified. Tape bandage and two braces had a highly significant influence on the talar tilt. The mean TT without support was decreased by using from 13.4 degrees to 4.9 degrees, by using one brace to 4.8 degrees and by using another brace to 5.9 degrees. These two braces are effective for protection during functional treatment. A classification into three grades of effectiveness is proposed. It is concluded that the stabilizing influence offered by bandages and braces should be measured before using the external support as a treatment device for acute ankle sprain and as a reliable protection against sprain injuries in daily living and sports."}]}

Participants in both groups received 10 sessions of individual standardised treatment over 10 weeks. For the following 12 weeks, the active group continued the home exercise programme and the placebo group received no treatment.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were pain and function measured by the shoulder pain and disability index, average pain on movement measured on an 11 point numerical rating scale, and participants' perceived global rating of overall change.\nRESULTS: 112 (93%) participants completed the 22 week trial. At 11 weeks no difference was found between groups for change in shoulder pain and disability index (3.6, 95% confidence interval -2.1 to 9.4) or change in pain (0.7, -0.1 to 1.5); both groups showed significant improvements.

Next, we highlight recently published longitudinal cohort and intervention studies that focus on arthritis prevention in the following topic areas: cognitive and behavioral strategies, obesity, exercise, and occupational injury prevention.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Few studies examined primary prevention strategies. In one study, an educational intervention significantly changed tick-related knowledge and behaviors among a population at risk of Lyme disease. Another population-based study used a mailed, stage-based educational program to successfully increase physical activity levels; this intervention may have practical application as a primary or tertiary prevention strategy for arthritis. Tertiary prevention research received much attention: Recent studies extend the benefits of exercise and cognitive-behavioral interventions to persons with different rheumatic conditions (eg, neck pain, low back pain, systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia). Longitudinal cohort studies improve our understanding of the relationships between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers, birth weight and hand osteoarthritis, and baseline balance and functional declines among older adults with knee pain.\nSUMMARY: Prevention of arthritis and its complications is an active focus of investigation.

Referral to a prescribed exercise programme resonated most closely with participants' tendency to attribute pain to a structural or mechanical defect. Psychological therapy brought with it connotations of social judgement, deviance and stigma. Experience of psychological therapy often exceeded expectation. Participants who engaged in cognitive reflection and behavioural adaptation reported an upward identity shift independent of increased physical exercise behaviour.\nCONCLUSIONS: A logical rationale for a health intervention is in itself insufficient to ensure uptake and participation.

Seventy-eight participants were randomized to listen to voice recordings that framed exercise-related pain as helpful vs. harmful before participating in a standard muscular endurance test using the YMCA protocol. Although the two experimental groups did not differ in the overall number of resistance training repetitions achieved, participants who were asked to think about the benefits (rather than the negative consequences) of pain reported less negative pain valence during exercise. Thus, the experience of pain was influenced by appraisals of the meaning of pain, but differences in pain valence did not impact exercise persistence.

Accurate assessment of these important clinical outcomes is integral to effective management of breathlessness of patients with COPD.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with stable moderate-to-severe COPD were tested at 6-week intervals at baseline, after a nonintervention control period (pre-EXT), and after EXT. Patients entered an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program involving regular exercise on a bicycle. Incremental symptom-limited exercise testing (1-min increments of 10 W) was performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. Oxygen uptake (O(2)), carbon dioxide output (CO(2)), minute ventilation (E), time, and volume components of the respiratory cycle and, in six patients, esophageal pressure swings (Pessw), both as actual values and as percentage of maximal (most negative in sign) esophageal pressure during sniff maneuver (Pessn), were measured continuously over the runs. Exertional dyspnea and leg effort were evaluated by administering a Borg scale.\nRESULTS: Measurements at baseline and pre-EXT were similar. Significant increase in exercise capacity was found in response to EXT: (1) peak work rate (WR), O(2), CO(2), E, tidal volume (VT), and heart rate increased, while peak exertional dyspnea and leg effort did not significantly change; (2) exertional dyspnea/O(2) and exertional dyspnea/CO(2) decreased while E/O(2) and E/CO(2) remained unchanged. The slope of both exertional dyspnea and leg effort relative to E fell significantly after EXT; (3) at standardized WR, E, and CO(2), exertional dyspnea and leg effort decreased while inspiratory capacity (IC) increased. Decrease in E was accomplished primarily by decrease in respiratory rate (RR) and increase in both inspiratory time (TI) and expiratory time; VT slightly increased, while inspiratory drive (VT/TI) and duty cycle (TI/total time of the respiratory cycle) remained unchanged.

In this study, the wet spirometer has been modified to investigate the fundamental laws of flow and different types of lung disease. This modification was achieved by changing the dimensions of the device, printing a scale on the bell, and attaching an airflow control system (ACS) between the corrugated tube and hollow tube of the inner cylinder. The ACS allowed for flow control during the exercises. Two exercises were performed: exercise I compared the parameters measured by the wet spirometer, modified spirometer, and computerized spirometer to determine the suitability of the modification, while exercise II tested the variables affecting flow. These exercises introduce students to data collection, analysis, and the use of statistical tests as they compare various spirometers. Additionally, students gain valuable experience in experimental design by conducting diverse experiments that investigate factors influencing flow dynamics. By plotting the results and participating in small group discussions, students can apply flow principles in respiratory and circulatory systems, offering a hands-on experience that integrates physics and physiology. The modified spirometer facilitated multifaceted topic exploration, surpassing the traditional wet spirometer's capabilities.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This activity involves cost-effective modifications to the wet spirometer, broadening its applicability. These modifications effectively address student challenges associated with wet spirometer handling and enhance comprehension of fluid dynamics, all without the need for costly simulations, wet experiments, or fragile instruments.

In the absence of guidelines specific to the CKD population, recent guidelines developed for older individuals and patients with chronic disease should be applied to the CKD population.

Each statement is based on a comprehensive review of the literature, clinical experience, and expert opinions. Overall, the statements affirm that regular physical activity and exercise training offer numerous benefits to CKD patients, including improved physical function, enhanced cardiometabolic and neuromuscular function, cognitive benefits, and an overall improvement in quality of life. Furthermore, exercise may provide nephroprotection and reduce mortality. These advantages are observed across all CKD stages, whether on conservative therapy or kidney replacement therapy (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), and in kidney transplant recipients. Moreover, when physical activity and exercise training are implemented with appropriate precautions, they are safe in CKD patients. Gradual physical activity and customized exercise programs should be tailored to the patient's exercise tolerance, potentially enhancing compliance. Clinicians are encouraged to use a series of questionnaires and tests to assess the patient's level of physical activity and performance. However, exercise and physical activity are poorly implemented in clinical practice due to many barriers related to patients and healthcare staff. Overcoming these barriers requires the proactive role of the nephrologists, who should actively incorporate exercise training and promote physical activity within routine care plans.

Loss of functional movement is a common consequence of stroke for which a wide range of interventions has been developed. Traditional therapeutic approaches have shown limited results for motor deficits as well as lack evidence for their effectiveness. Stroke rehabilitation is now based on the evidence of neuroplasticity, which is responsible for recovery following stroke. The neuroplastic changes in the structure and function of relevant brain areas are induced primarily by specific rehabilitation methods. The therapeutic method which induces neuroplastic changes, leads to greater motor and functional recovery than traditional methods. Further, the recovery is permanent in nature. During the last decade various novel stroke rehabilitative methods for motor recovery have been developed. This review focuses on the methods that have evidence of associated cortical level reorganization, namely task-specific training, constraint-induced movement therapy, robotic training, mental imaging, and virtual training. All of these methods utilize principles of motor learning. The findings from this review demonstrated convincing evidence both at the neural and functional level in response to such therapies. The main aim of the review was to determine the evidence for these methods and their application into clinical practice."}, {"pmcid": "18256679", "title": "Training and exercise to drive poststroke recovery.", "text": "To make practical recommendations regarding therapeutic strategies for the rehabilitation of patients with hemiparetic stroke, it is important to have a general understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the neuroplasticity that is induced by skills training and by exercise programs designed to increase muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness. Recent clinical trials have provided insights into methods that promote adaptations within the nervous system that correlate with improved walking and upper extremity function, and that can be instigated at any time after stroke onset. Data obtained to date indicate that patients who have mild to moderate levels of impairment and disability can benefit from interventions that depend on repetitive task-oriented practice at the intensity and duration necessary to reach a plateau in a reacquired skill. Studies are underway to lessen the consequences of more-severe motor deficits by drawing on medications that augment plasticity, biological interventions that promote neural repair, and strategies that employ electrical stimulation and robotics."}, {"pmcid": "22186963", "title": "Learning, not adaptation, characterizes stroke motor recovery: evidence from kinematic changes induced by robot-assisted therapy in trained and untrained task in the same workspace.", "text": "Both the American Heart Association and the VA/DoD endorse upper-extremity robot-mediated rehabilitation therapy for stroke care.

Here, we explore whether we must train patients for each functional task that they must perform during their activities of daily living or alternatively capacitate patients to perform a class of tasks and have therapists assist them later in translating the observed gains into activities of daily living. The former implies that motor adaptation is a better model for motor recovery. The latter implies that motor learning (which allows for generalization) is a better model for motor recovery. We quantified trained and untrained movements performed by 158 recovering stroke patients via 13 metrics, including movement smoothness and submovements. Improvements were observed both in trained and untrained movements suggesting that generalization occurred. Our findings suggest that, as motor recovery progresses, an internal representation of the task is rebuilt by the brain in a process that better resembles motor learning than motor adaptation. Our findings highlight possible improvements for therapeutic algorithms design, suggesting sparse-activity-set training should suffice over exhaustive sets of task specific training."}]}

There were significant improvements in the 10-km time trial performance and peak power. There was also significant improvement in relative peak power for both groups. The 10-km time trial performance and relative peak power showed a moderate inverse correlation.\nCONCLUSION: These findings showed that both intermittent sprint and plyometric training resulted in improved 10-km running performance despite reduction in training mileage.

The ability to produce the best possible average sprint performance over a series of sprints (≤10 seconds), separated by short (≤60 seconds) recovery periods has been termed repeated-sprint ability (RSA). RSA is therefore an important fitness requirement of team-sport athletes, and it is important to better understand training strategies that can improve this fitness component. Surprisingly, however, there has been little research about the best training methods to improve RSA. In the absence of strong scientific evidence, two principal training theories have emerged. One is based on the concept of training specificity and maintains that the best way to train RSA is to perform repeated sprints. The second proposes that training interventions that target the main factors limiting RSA may be a more effective approach. The aim of this review (Part II) is to critically analyse training strategies to improve both RSA and the underlying factors responsible for fatigue during repeated sprints (see Part I of the preceding companion article). This review has highlighted that there is not one type of training that can be recommended to best improve RSA and all of the factors believed to be responsible for performance decrements during repeated-sprint tasks. This is not surprising, as RSA is a complex fitness component that depends on both metabolic (e.g. oxidative capacity, phosphocreatine recovery and H+ buffering) and neural factors (e.g. muscle activation and recruitment strategies) among others. While different training strategies can be used in order to improve each of these potential limiting factors, and in turn RSA, two key recommendations emerge from this review; it is important to include (i) some training to improve single-sprint performance (e.g. 'traditional' sprint training and strength/power training); and (ii) some high-intensity (80-90% maximal oxygen consumption) interval training to best improve the ability to recover between sprints. Further research is required to establish whether it is best to develop these qualities separately, or whether they can be developed concurrently (without interference effects). While research has identified a correlation between RSA and total sprint distance during soccer, future studies need to address whether training-induced changes in RSA also produce changes in match physical performance."}, {"pmcid": "21869624", "title": "The effect of 40-m repeated sprint training on maximum sprinting speed, repeated sprint speed endurance, vertical jump, and aerobic capacity in young elite male soccer players.", "text": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 10 weeks' 40-m repeated sprint training program that does not involve strength training on sprinting speed and repeated sprint speed on young elite soccer players.

A multifactorial approach (nutrition education, behavior modification and exercise) is needed to improve adherence to diet in mild and moderate obesity and to maintain weight loss. More than a formal physical exercise program for a couple of months, the obese need to include physical activity permanently as a part of everyday life."}, {"pmcid": "30385379", "title": "Exercise in the management of obesity.", "text": "Obesity is a multifactorial disease with increasing incidence and burden on societies worldwide. Obesity can be managed through everyday behavioral changes involving energy intake and energy expenditure. Concerning the latter, there is strong evidence that regular exercise contributes to body weight and fat loss, maintenance of body weight and fat reduction, and metabolic fitness in obesity. Appropriate exercise programs should ideally combine large negative energy balance, long-term adherence, and beneficial effects on health and well-being. Endurance training appears to be the most effective in this respect, although resistance training and high-intensity interval training play distinct roles in the effectiveness of exercise interventions. With weight regain being so common, weight loss maintenance is probably the greatest challenge in the successful treatment of obesity. There is an established association between higher levels of physical activity and greater weight loss maintenance, based on the abundance of evidence from prospective observational studies and retrospective analyses. However, proving a causative relationship between exercise and weight loss maintenance is difficult at present. Exercise has the potential to alleviate the health consequences of obesity, even in the absence of weight loss. All in all, exercise constitutes an indispensable, yet often underestimated, tool in the management of obesity."}, {"pmcid": "37142892", "title": "Physical activity and exercise for weight loss and maintenance in people living with obesity.", "text": "Physical activity and exercise training programs are integral part of a comprehensive obesity management approach. In persons with overweight or obesity, exercise training, specifically aerobic (i.e. endurance) training, is associated with significant additional weight loss compared to the absence of training. However the magnitude of effect remains modest amounting to only 2-3 kg additional weight loss on average. Comparable effects have been observed for total fat loss. Exercise training, specifically aerobic training, is also associated with decreased abdominal visceral fat as assessed by imaging techniques, which is likely to benefit cardiometabolic health in persons with obesity. Based on data from controlled trials with randomization after prior weight loss, the evidence for weight maintenance with exercise training is as yet not conclusive, although retrospective analyses point to the value of relatively high-volume exercise in this regard. Resistance (i.e. muscle-strengthening) training is specifically advised for lean mass preservation during weight loss. Given the relatively limited effect of exercise training on weight loss as such, the changes in physical fitness brought about by exercise training cannot be overlooked as they provide major health benefits to persons with obesity. Aerobic, as well as combined aerobic and resistance training, increase cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) while resistance training, but not aerobic training, improves muscle strength even in the absence of a significant change in muscle mass.

However the magnitude of this effect remains modest, amounting to only 2-3 kg additional weight or fat loss on average. We therefore argue that this conversation needs to be re-oriented towards the many potential health benefits of physical activity that can be seen beyond weight loss. Exercise training has been shown to improve the cardiometabolic risk profile by effects including decreasing abdominal visceral fat and improving insulin sensitivity. Aerobic, as well as combined aerobic and resistance (i.e. strength) training, increase cardiorespiratory fitness, a major risk factor for ill health. Resistance training improves muscle strength, another major component of physical fitness, even in the absence of a significant change in muscle mass.

The values of PMEAN in Set3 (492.15 [87.61] W) were significantly higher than in Set2 (480.05 [82.10] W) and Set1 (467.65 [79.18] W). Similarly, the results of PPEAK in Set3 (713.10 [132.72] W) were significantly higher than those obtained in Set2 (702.25 [129.5] W) and Set1 (671.55 [115.79] W). For the ECCSLO tempo (6/0/X/0) in Set2 (587.9 [138.48] W), the results of PPEAK were significantly higher than in Set1 (565.7 [117.37] W) and Set3 (563.1 [124.93] W).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the postactivation potentiation effect is observed for both slow and medium tempos of movement."}]}

Examination of repetition data showed that load intensity (% 1RM) generally had a direct effect on forces, contraction times, impulses, and work (i.e., increasing with load), whereas power varied across loads (p < 0.001). However, total-repetition forces, contraction times, impulses, work, and power were all greater in the hypertrophy scheme (p < 0.001), because of the greater number of repetitions performed (volume) as well as lifting technique. No differences in total forces were found between the equal-volume power and maximal strength schemes, but the former did produce greater total contraction times, work, and power (p < 0.001), which may also be attributed to repetition and technique differences. Total impulses were the only variable greater in the maximal strength scheme (p < 0.001).

Subjects performed squats using either two second (SLOW) or explosive concentric contractions (EXPL), but identical repetitions (8), sets (4), and loads (60% 1RM). A secondary objective was to compare high- versus moderate-intensity exercise. Thus, a third protocol was performed that also used explosive contractions, with heavier loads (80% 1RM) and six sets of four reps (HEAVYEXPL). Eccentric reps (2 s), work (reps x sets x load), range of motion, and rest intervals between sets (90 s) were identical among all three protocols.

There has been rapid adoption of non-immersive virtual reality as a rehabilitation strategy despite the limited evidence about its safety and effectiveness. Our aim was to compare the safety and efficacy of virtual reality with recreational therapy on motor recovery in patients after an acute ischaemic stroke.\nMETHODS: In this randomised, controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial we enrolled adults (aged 18-85 years) who had a first-ever ischaemic stroke and a motor deficit of the upper extremity score of 3 or more (measured with the Chedoke-McMaster scale) within 3 months of randomisation from 14 in-patient stroke rehabilitation units from four countries (Canada [11], Argentina [1], Peru [1], and Thailand [1]). Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) by a computer-generated assignment at enrolment to receive a programme of structured, task-oriented, upper extremity sessions (ten sessions, 60 min each) of either non-immersive virtual reality using the Nintendo Wii gaming system (VRWii) or simple recreational activities (playing cards, bingo, Jenga, or ball game) as add-on therapies to conventional rehabilitation over a 2 week period. All investigators assessing outcomes were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was upper extremity motor performance measured by total time to complete the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) at the end of the 2 week intervention period, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NTC01406912.\nFINDINGS: The study was done between May 12, 2012, and Oct 1, 2015. We randomly assigned 141 patients: 71 received VRWii therapy and 70 received recreational activity. 121 (86%) patients (59 in the VRWii group and 62 in the recreational activity group) completed the final assessment and were included in the primary analysis. Each group improved WMFT performance time relative to baseline (decrease in median time from 43·7 s [IQR 26·1-68·0] to 29·7 s [21·4-45·2], 32·0% reduction for VRWii vs 38·0 s [IQR 28·0-64·1] to 27·1 s [21·2-45·5], 28·7% reduction for recreational activity). Mean time of conventional rehabilitation during the trial was similar between groups (VRWii, 373 min [SD 322] vs recreational activity, 397 min [345]; p=0·70) as was the total duration of study intervention (VRWii, 528 min [SD 155] vs recreational activity, 541 min [142]; p=0·60). Multivariable analysis adjusted for baseline WMFT score, age, sex, baseline Chedoke-McMaster, and stroke severity revealed no significant difference between groups in the primary outcome (adjusted mean estimate of difference in WMFT: 4·1 s, 95% CI -14·4 to 22·6). There were three serious adverse events during the trial, all deemed to be unrelated to the interventions (seizure after discharge and intracerebral haemorrhage in the recreational activity group and heart attack in the VRWii group). Overall incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar between treatment groups.\nINTERPRETATION: In patients who had a stroke within the 3 months before enrolment and had mild-to-moderate upper extremity motor impairment, non-immersive virtual reality as an add-on therapy to conventional rehabilitation was not superior to a recreational activity intervention in improving motor function, as measured by WMFT. Our study suggests that the type of task used in motor rehabilitation post-stroke might be less relevant, as long as it is intensive enough and task-specific.

Various VR systems (customized and commercially available) were used as rehabilitation tools. Outcome measures included laboratory and clinical measures of balance and gait. Outcome measures of dynamic balance showed significant improvements following VR-based interventions as compared to other interventions. Further, it was observed that VR-based intervention may have favorable effects in improving walking speed and the ability to deal with environmental challenges, which may also facilitate independent community ambulation. VR-based therapy thus has the potential to be a useful tool for balance and gait training for stroke rehabilitation. Utilization of motor learning principles related to task-related training may have been an important factor leading to positive results. Other principles such as repetition, feedback etc. were used in studies but were not explored explicitly and may need to be investigated to further improve the strength of results.

A subset of participants who used the system at home produced 1593 ± 197 discrete movements per day. Participants demonstrated a high degree of engagement while using the system at home, typically completing nearly double the number of assigned exercises per day. These findings indicate that the open-source RePlay system may be a feasible tool to facilitate access to rehabilitative exercises and potentially improve overall patient outcomes."}]}

For all three athletes, peak mechanical power and average mechanical power were strongly correlated with jump height (r = 0.54-0.90).

These results confirm that the strong correlation between jump height and power is an artefact arising from how power is calculated. Power is a compound variable calculated from the product of instantaneous ground reaction force and instantaneous velocity, and application of statistical theory shows that the correlation between jump height and power is artificially inflated by the near-perfect correlation between jump height and the velocity at peak power.

To be well tolerated, exercise programs must start at a level just below the capacity of the participants and then progress slowly. Even with these precautions, exercise may still produce tolerable, short-term increases in pain and fatigue that should abate within the first few weeks of exercising.\nSUMMARY: Future studies should investigate the possible benefits of low-intensity exercise and test strategies that may enhance long-term compliance with exercise. Individuals with fibromyalgia also need to be able to access community exercise programs that are appropriate for them. This may require community instructors to receive instruction on exercise prescription and progression for individuals with fibromyalgia."}, {"pmcid": "12849716", "title": "Physical exercise in fibromyalgia and related syndromes.", "text": "Fibromyalgia and related syndromes are characterized by chronic pain and fatigue. This chapter identifies the types of exercise that are effective for these patients and provides recommendations for exercise prescriptions. Based on a systematic review of randomized controlled studies of exercise, we suggest that low-intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking, can improve function and symptoms. Aerobic exercise performed twice a week at moderate intensity can improve aerobic capacity and reduce tenderness. Pool exercise can improve function, distress and symptoms. Strength training at adequate load can improve strength without exacerbation of symptoms. Most patients tolerate low-intensity exercise. High-intensity exercise should be undertaken with caution. Due to the large variability of functioning and symptom severity in patient populations, exercise prescriptions should be individualized and should include a long-term plan to maximize functioning and wellbeing.

Effective treatments that target sub-threshold or mild to moderate levels of disorder in young people are required to reduce the risk of persistence and recurrence. The aims of this study are to evaluate whether treatments that are less intensive than cognitive-behaviour therapy, such as problem solving therapy and exercise treatments, are acceptable and effective in managing depression and anxiety symptoms in young people and to identify possible attributes in those who are likely to respond to these treatments.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: This is a factorial randomised controlled trial conducted at a large, metropolitan youth mental health service. Participants are young help-seekers aged 15-25 years with sub-threshold or mild to moderate levels of depression and anxiety (with or without comorbid substance use). The interventions comprise 4 treatment combinations delivered by psychologists over 6 sessions on a weekly basis: a psychological intervention (problem solving therapy versus supportive counselling) and an exercise intervention (behavioural exercise versus psychoeducation). Structured assessments occur at baseline, mid-point, end-point (6 weeks) and at a 6- and 12-month follow-up.

We explored the potential mediating effects of changes in mood states in the relationship between exercise intensity and alcohol cravings.\nMETHOD: Secondary analyses of a nested single-arm trial within a randomized controlled trial (FitForChange). In total, 117 sedentary adults (68.4% female, M = 52 ± 12 years) with clinician diagnosed (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition) AUD and indications of craving (Desire for Alcohol Questionnaire) completed a 12-min submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness test on a cycle ergometer. Assessments of craving, mood states (POMS), and state anxiety (STAI-Y1) were taken immediately before, after, and 30 min after exercise. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were included as indirect measures of exercise intensity. The med4way command in Stata was used to explore mediating and interaction effects of improvements in total mood disturbance (TMD) and state anxiety.\nRESULTS: Improvements in mood and anxiety did not mediate the effect of higher exercise intensity on reductions in alcohol craving. A significant reference interaction was found between \"hard\" (or greater) exertion and anxiety improvements (β = -1.06, 95% CI [-1.50, -0.61]).

Although energy expenditure, not intensity or duration, seems to determine the amount of weight loss attributable to exercise, it is not clear whether changes in the components of body mass are also insensitive to these parameters. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare the effect of two isoenergetic exercise training programmes, one of low and one of high intensity, on body composition. Fourteen healthy premenopausal untrained women were divided into two equivalent groups, which exercised on treadmill at 45 or 72 % of V(O2max) four times a week for three months, spending 1548 kJ (370 kcal) per exercise session. No dietary intervention was applied. Body mass decreased significantly in both groups but more in the low-intensity than the high-intensity group (by mean +/- SD, 3.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.9 kg, p = 0.032).

In conclusion, exercise training at 45 % of V(O2max) without dietary restriction produced a higher weight loss than at 72 % of V(O2max), whereas the higher intensity tended to maintain fat-free mass, possibly, in part, through the smaller weight loss.

Participants in the first facility used low-intensity bodyweight training with slow movement (the LST group, n = 65), and participants in another facility used machine training (the control group, n = 31). Exercises were conducted for 3 months, once or twice a week, depending on the required level of nursing care. Changes in motor function were examined.\nRESULTS: Post-exercise measurements showed significant improvements from the pre-exercise levels after 3 months, based on the results of the Timed Up and Go test (p = 0.0263) and chair-stand test (p = 0.0016) in the low-intensity exercise with slow movement and tonic force generation (LST) group. Although the ability to stand on one leg with eyes open tended to improve, no significant change was found (p = 0.0964).\nCONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that carrying out LST bodyweight training for 3 months led to improvements in ambulatory function and lower-limb muscle strength. In this way, it is possible that LST training performed by holding a bar or by staying seated on a chair contributes to improved motor function in elderly patients within a short time.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000030853 .

This prompted an investigation to evaluate muscle activity and the associated changes in strength and lean body mass resulting from a passive exercise program. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers, aged 26 to 44 years, participated in this six-week study. Lean body mass changes were evaluated by tetrapolar bioelectric impedance measurements, strength changes by isokinetic strength evaluation, and muscle activity by surface EMG techniques. Reproducible muscle activity was recorded in all three muscles studied during two of three preselected exercises. This involuntary muscle activity was attributed to fusimotor and postural reflexes. No significant change (p greater than .05), however, occurred in muscle strength or lean body mass at the end of the six weeks. Lack of these physiologic changes in light of the documented muscle activity is attributed to insufficient training effect."}]}

Following exercise training, women, but not men, improved in most measures of physical function and reported fewer symptoms.

Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (intermittent claudication) is present in 3% to 7% of patients over the age of 60. The attraction of minimally invasive, percutaneous endovascular angioplasty (PTA) for this large number of patients has resulted in multiple trials of new PTA +/- stenting devices. The purpose of this report is to determine whether trials should include controlled patients who have optimal medical management including supervised exercise.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In 2007 through 2008, there were 12 active trials of PTA and stent with 9 of the trials randomized and 6 trials using PTA as the control arm. No trial used a medically managed group. Between 1990 and 2008, a search of PubMed disclosed six publications (five randomized trials) comparing PTA +/- stent with medically (exercise) managed claudicants. None of the medically managed patient groups experienced a significant increase in ABI, whereas endovascular patients had an early increase in ABI, which was variably sustained to 1 and 2 years. However, after 6 months, the maximum walking distance was significantly increased in the exercised patients and remained longer than that of the interventional group in four of five trials at 1 to 2 years.\nCONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment was superior to medical treatment in functional outcome at 1 year in only one of the five randomized trials for claudication. In the other four trials, medical treatment produced a greater maximum walking distance at 1 to 2 years. Current trials lack optimal medical controls. New trials of PTA + stent should include a medically managed group of patients in a supervised exercise program as the comparator arm. The outcome measure should be maximum walking distance to demonstrate added functional benefit of the new device."}]}

The facility by which isokinetic dynamometers provide information about dynamic muscle contractions has, no doubt, been a major factor in this popularity. Isokinetic dynamometers are passive devices which resist applied forces and control the speed of exercise at a predetermined rate. Such dynamometers generally provide a record of applied force throughout a joint range of motion. Some of the postulated advantages of isokinetic exercise include safety, accommodating resistance and the facility for muscle force analysis. In spite of the advantages that isokinetic dynamometry provides, there are a number of considerations that are important in the interpretation of force recordings. While the term \"isokinetics\" generally denotes a type of muscular contraction which accompanies a constant rate of limb movement, periods of acceleration and deceleration exist in the context of isokinetic exercise. The acceleration and subsequent oscillatory and deceleration periods of \"isokinetic\" exercise limit the duration of the period of constant velocity in exercises with isokinetic dynamometry. Impact artifacts on torque records result from the compliance of the dynamometer system as it adjusts the accelerating limb to the present speed. The position at which peak torque occurs in a joint range varies with speed of motion. Therefore, analysis of maximal values at specific joint angles across speeds should be made in addition to the peak values generated throughout a joint range. The shape of the isokinetic force-velocity curve differs from the classic curve derived from prepared muscle specimens. As speed approaches zero, the isokinetic muscular force tends to rise much less steeply than that of the in vitro curve. Because measurements of absolute maximal force or velocity are subject to constraints in human studies, the direct comparison of in vivo to in vitro force-velocity curves is not justified. Neural inhibition of the force generated in intact muscle as tension rises has been postulated as a possible mechanism retarding the force curve at slow speeds. The reliability of specific types of isokinetic dynamometers appears to be quite high when test-retest analyses are performed with inert weights. Whether submaximal or maximal warm-ups are essential to ensure stable measures is still questionable at this time. It seems prudent to recommend submaximal warm-ups prior to maximal testing in order to reduce the possibility of muscle strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}]}

Over 60% of physiotherapists in Ghana had less than 5 years of practice experience, worked in large facility hospitals and had no post-graduate further training. Most LBP patients seen were chronic, and over 60% of treatment sessions used multiple therapies and included exercises, advice, massage, electrotherapy and manual therapy.\nCONCLUSION: This first mapping of physiotherapy management of LBP in Ghana shows an overt multimodal approach.

Accordingly, it might be beneficial to include neuromuscular training (NMT) applied during Ramadan to avoid detraining and promote injury prevention in soccer players. This study aimed to analyze NMT effects on physical fitness and injury prevention during the Ramadan fasting period in young soccer players.\nMETHODS: Forty young highly-trained male soccer players (U17/U19) were randomly assigned to a NMT (n = 20) or a traditional soccer-specific training group (TT, n = 20). NMT was conducted during Ramadan, lasted four weeks, and included two weekly sessions with exercises to promote muscle strength, power (plyometrics), speed, balance. TT contents were similar to the training period before Ramadan and comprised two weekly sessions including endurance and sprint-based exercises. The training volume was similar between groups. Body composition (body fat), linear sprint (5-m, 10-m, 30-m sprint), and change-of-direction (CoD) speed (T-test with and without ball), muscle power (squat [SJ], countermovement jump [CMJ]), peak isokinetic torque of the knee flexors, extensors, and soccer-specific performance (Loughborough soccer passing test [LSPT], Yoyo intermittent test level 1 [YYIRT L1], repeated-shuttle-sprint ability test [RSSA]) were determined before and after the Ramadan period.

Performance (vertical jump height), physiological (heart rate and tympanic temperature), and perceptual measures (perceived quality of recovery) were determined before each match, 10 minutes after each match, after each recovery method, and after 24 hours. There was a 0.6 +/- 6.7% drop in immediately after a match, but there was no difference in vertical jump height after 24 hours (p = 0.997). Perceived quality of recovery immediately after COMB was substantially higher than CONT and PASS, but the effect did not last more than 24 hours. The players perceived lighter legs after COMB, compared with the PASS, at post-24 hours. In conclusion, a combined recovery modality (cold water immersion and active recovery) after a soccer match did not have a substantial effect on vertical jump height performance when compared with contrast water immersion and passive recovery alone. However, the observed positive effects on perceived recovery (higher quality of recovery and lighter legs) after the combined modality (cold water immersion and active recovery) suggest that this approach may be effective for young players after intense soccer match play."}]}

Repeated measures of ANOVA indicated that there were no significant changes in body weight, body mass index, fat free mass, percentage of body fat, daily sleeping time and daily caloric intake associated with Ramadan fasting. No significant changes were found in total body water either, but urinary density measured at End-RF was significantly higher than After-RF.

Functional ability tests were chair rise, kneel rise, rise from lying on the floor, 118-m self-paced corridor walk, stair climbing, functional reach, stepping up, stepping down, and lifting weights onto a shelf. Pre- and posttraining comparisons were made using analysis of variance or analysis of covariance (using weight as a covariate) for normally distributed continuous data and one-sided Fishers exact test (2 x 2 table) for discontinuous data.\nRESULTS: Improvements in IKES (mean change 27%, P = .03), IEFS (22%, P = .05), HGS (4%, P = .05), LEP/kg (18%, P = .05) were associated with training, but the improvement in LEP (18%, P = .11) did not reach statistical significance.

Muscle biopsies were obtained from 11 subjects (8 exercisers/3 controls) at baseline and after 15 weeks; exercisers underwent another biopsy at 30 weeks. After testing maximum strength using the 1-RM method, the exercisers began a 12-exercise circuit (3 sets of 8 repetitions at 75% of 1-RM), 3 times a week. The controls repeated the strength testing every 15 weeks. They were asked to continue usual activities and not to start any exercise program.\nRESULTS: With exercise, muscle strength increased, average increases ranging from 30% (hip extensors) to 97% (hip flexors). Strength increased rapidly over 3 months, then plateaued for the duration of the experiment. No strength changes were observed in sedentary controls. Cross-sectional area of type 1 muscle fibers increased in exercisers by 15 weeks (29.4 +/- 1%, p < .02) and after 30 weeks (58.5 +/- 13.7%, p < .002) compared to baseline.

Repair of injured skeletal muscle is an area that continues to present a challenge for sports medicine clinicians and researchers due, in part, to complete muscle recovery being compromised by development of fibrosis leading to loss of function and susceptibility to re-injury. Injured skeletal muscle goes through a series of coordinated and interrelated phases of healing including degeneration, inflammation, regeneration and fibrosis. Muscle regeneration initiated shortly after injury can be limited by fibrosis which affects the degree of recovery and predisposes the muscle to reinjury. It has been demonstrated in animal studies that antifibrotic agents that inactivate transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 have been effective at decreasing scar tissue formation. Several studies have also shown that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can increase the efficiency of skeletal muscle repair by increasing angiogenesis and, at the same time, reducing the accumulation of fibrosis. We have isolated and thoroughly characterised a population of skeletal muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) that enhance repair of damaged skeletal muscle fibres by directly differentiating into myofibres and secreting paracrine factors that promote tissue repair. Indeed, we have found that MDSCs transplanted into skeletal and cardiac muscles have been successful at repair probably because of their ability to secrete VEGF that works in a paracrine fashion. The application of these techniques to the study of sport-related muscle injuries awaits investigation. Other useful strategies to enhance skeletal muscle repair through increased vascularisation may include gene therapy, exercise, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and, potentially, massage therapy. Based on recent studies showing an accelerated recovery of muscle function from intense eccentric exercise through massage-based therapies, we believe that this treatment modality offers a practical and non-invasive form of therapy for skeletal muscle injuries.

Although new approaches to facilitate bone and fibrous tissue healing have shown promise (e.g., the use of cytokines, cell transplants, and gene therapy), none has been proved to offer beneficial effects comparable to those produced by loading of healing tissues. For these reasons, patients with musculoskeletal injuries and those who have recently undergone surgery are now being treated with controlled physical activity that loads their healing tissues.

Little information about nutritional support for injuries exists.\nREVIEW: Immediately following injury, wound healing begins with an inflammatory response. Excessive anti-inflammatory measures may impair recovery. Many injuries result in limb immobilization. Immobilization results in muscle loss due to increased periods of negative muscle protein balance. Oxidative capacity of muscle is also decreased. Nutrient and energy deficiencies should be avoided. Energy expenditure may be reduced during immobilization, but inflammation, wound healing and the energy cost of ambulation limit the reduction of energy expenditure. There is little rationale for increasing protein intake during immobilization. There is a theoretical rationale for leucine and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation to help reduce muscle atrophy. During rehabilitation and recovery from immobilization, increased activity, in particular resistance exercise will increase muscle protein synthesis and restore sensitivity to anabolic stimuli. Ample, but not excessive, protein and energy must be consumed to support muscle growth. During rehabilitation and recovery, nutritional needs are very much like those for any athlete desiring muscle growth.\nCONCLUSION: Nutrition is important for optimal wound healing.

A systematic review.", "text": "BACKGROUND: For patients with diabetic foot ulcers, offloading is one crucial aspect of treatment and aims to redistribute pressure away from the ulcer site. In addition to offloading strategies, patients are often advised to reduce their activity levels. Consequently, patients may avoid exercise altogether. However, it has been suggested that exercise induces an increase in vasodilation and tissue blood flow, which may potentially facilitate ulcer healing. The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether exercise improves healing of diabetic foot ulcers.\nREVIEW: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMBASE between July 6, 2009 and July 6, 2019 using the key terms and subject headings diabetes, diabetic foot, physical activity, exercise, resistance training and wound healing. Randomised controlled trials were included in this review. Three randomised controlled trials (139 participants) were included in this systematic review. All studies incorporated a form of non-weight bearing exercise as the intervention over a 12-week period. One study conducted the intervention in a supervised setting, while two studies conducted the intervention in an unsupervised setting. Two studies found greater improvement in percentage wound size reduction in the intervention group compared with the control group, with one of these studies achieving statistically significant findings (p < 0.05). The results of the third study demonstrated statistically significant findings for total wound size reduction (p < 0.05), however results were analysed within each treatment group and not between groups.\nCONCLUSION: This systematic review found there is insufficient evidence to conclusively support non-weight bearing exercise as an intervention to improve healing of diabetic foot ulcers. Regardless, the results demonstrate some degree of wound size reduction and there were no negative consequences of the intervention for the participants. Given the potential benefits of exercise on patient health and wellbeing, non-weight bearing exercise should be encouraged as part of the management plan for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

We have conducted a systematic review to examine the effects of exercise on wound characteristics, including time to heal, size and recurrence, pain, quality of life, adverse events, and economic outcomes. This review was registered with PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016046407.

Six studies met the inclusion criteria, but all had design flaws leading to biases, most commonly performance and selective reporting bias. Three studies compared a progressive resistance exercise programme (PREG) plus compression with compression alone for a period of 12 weeks. Low-quality evidence indicates the following: possibly no difference in the proportion of ulcers healed (risk ratio [RR] 1.14, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.84, I[2] 36%; 3 trials, 116 participants); probably no difference in quality of life (mean difference [MD] 3 points better on 100 point scale with exercise, 95% CI -1.89 to 7.89, 1 trial, 59 participants); possible increase in the risk of adverse events with exercise (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.85, 1 RCT, 40 participants); and no difference in ankle range of motion and calf muscle pump. Evidence was downgraded due to susceptibility to bias and imprecision. Recurrence, pain, and economic outcomes were not measured in these trials, and time to healing was measured but not fully reported in 1 trial. We are uncertain of the effects of other interventions (community-based exercise and behaviour modification, ten thousand steps, supervised vs unsupervised exercise) due to the availability of low- or very low-quality evidence only from single trials. The review highlights the need for further research, with larger sample sizes, to properly address the significance of the effect of exercise on VLU wound characteristics."}]}

Pain relief and functional improvement is excellent and can allow patients to maintain an active lifestyle. Criteria for the type of prostheses selected should include diagnosis, age, functional level, severity of the disease, and patient expectations. Improved instrumentation, attention to surgical detail, including soft tissue balancing of the knee, and the use of polyethylene inserts greater than 8 mm have led to excellent long-term results and low failure rates. Recent improvements in revision total knee systems should significantly improve the long-term results of revision knee arthroplasty. The addition of modular implants has greatly increased the versatility of most systems and allows the surgeon to custom tailor the implant, contingent upon the amount of bony and ligamentous deficiency of the knee. The future goals of total knee arthroplasty include the development of knee systems that mimic normal joint kinematics with improved fixation and decreased polyethylene wear rates."}, {"pmcid": "20162713", "title": "Wear, delamination, and fatigue resistance of melt-annealed highly crosslinked UHMWPE cruciate-retaining knee inserts under activities of daily living.", "text": "The wear, delamination, and fatigue resistance of artificially aged gamma irradiation-sterilized conventional polyethylene (CPE) and gas-plasma-sterilized melt-annealed highly crosslinked polyethylene tibial inserts (HXPE) were compared.

Another six HXPE (72 kGy) and six CPE inserts were also tested under conditions that could produce severe delamination for 8 Mc. Ten other knees (five 72 kGy HXPE and five CPE) were subjected to posterior edge loading fatigue testing for 5 Mc. The HXPE inserts had an average wear rate reduction of about 80% relative to their CPE counterparts during all activities. All of the CPE inserts delaminated and fractured during high cycle deep squat (152 degrees flexion) motions, while all the HXPE remained intact. None of the HXPE inserts delaminated after 8 Mc, while all of the CPE inserts developed delamination damage within 1.5-5.8 Mc of delamination testing. All CPE inserts developed subsurface cracks and delamination within 2.8 Mc during posterior edge loading fatigue studies, while none of the HXPE inserts showed cracking or delamination after 5 Mc.

After testing, participants had 2 minutes of rest and then were encouraged to keep themselves on a pull-up bar for 30 seconds. During all procedures, muscular activity of FD and ED was measured by surface electromyography (EMG). Statistical analysis has revealed that the EMG measured in the FD during the static pull-up bar exercise after SQUAT condition was significantly higher (P = .004) than the CONTROL and PUSH-UP conditions.
